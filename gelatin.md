# Gelatin
1. Add 3/4 cup of water to your measuring cup (more if doing more than 5 gallons of beer)
2. Heat the water slightly before adding the gelatin, this helps it dissolve quicker.
3. Add 1 tsp of gelatin – I stir with the thermometer to get a reading. You’re looking to heat the solution to 150-155F, I do this by microwaving in short 5-10 second bursts. Obviously, all microwaves are different, just avoid boiling it.How to Use Gelatin to Clarify Your Beer (Dissolving the Gelatin)
4. Once you hit the target temperature, take the lid off of your keg (or fermenter) and pour the solution directly into your beer.
	* If you add gelatin into a keg, make sure you reconnect your CO2 line and purge the headspace
	* If you add gelatin into a fermenter, replace the airlock
5. Wait 24-48 hours while the gelatin works its magic
