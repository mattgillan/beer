<!-- TITLE: Gelatin -->

# Gelatin
Add with late addition dry-hops or around 48 hours prior to bottling.

1. For a 20L batch, add 3/4 cup of water to your measuring cup.
2. Heat the water slightly before adding the gelatin, this helps it dissolve quicker.
3. Add 1 tsp of gelatin, stir with the thermometer to get a reading. Youâ€™re looking to heat the solution to 65-68C, I do this by microwaving in short 5-10 second bursts. Obviously, all microwaves are different, just avoid boiling it. 
4. Once you hit the target temperature, take the lid off of your keg (or fermenter) and pour the solution directly into your beer.
	* If you add gelatin into a keg, make sure you reconnect your CO2 line and purge the headspace.
	* If you add gelatin into a fermenter, replace the airlock.
5. Wait 24-48 hours while the gelatin works its magic.
